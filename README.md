# Quiz Program

This program allows you to take a 10 question quiz where the order of answers are randomized. At the end, you will receive a score. It also allows for one to keep playing the game, keeping track of the high score as you play.

If you would like to change the questions, simply add or remove questions from the dictionary. Answers can be in singular form or a list of accepted answers. However, answers must be in lowercase.
